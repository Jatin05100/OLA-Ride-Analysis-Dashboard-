# OLA-Ride-Analysis-Dashboard-

This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride data to understand booking patterns and customer behavior. It shows the total number of bookings, how many were successful, and how many were cancelled. It also includes ratings given by both drivers and customers to understand service quality.

The dashboard highlights the top 5 most frequent customers and the most used payment method, helping to identify loyal users and preferred payment types. It also shows details of each vehicle, like how much distance it has traveled and how many of its rides were successful.
